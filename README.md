# NotCron
*A small alternative to Cron.*

NotCron is a simple and easy way to schedule tasks without the hassle of using Cron. It lends a lot of language and design from an earlier project of mine, TaskScout, and has the following goals:

- Easy task scheduling by utilizing plain language rather than timestamps.
- Support for repeating tasks.
- Low memory footprint.
- Human-readable configuration files.
- BASH scripting rather than the utilization of other, more complicated and resource-intensive languages.

Though tools exist to schedule tasks in Bash, this script aims to be more powerful than those tools while retaining the same ease of use that they possess as opposed to the difficulty associated with Cron. This isn't a replacement for Cron -- Just a lightweight tool that can sometimes be used in place of it.
